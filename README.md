# Learn english colors

This is a Python script I write to help my daughter to learn to recognize and to write colors in english.

It uses the OSX `say` speech synthesis manager via `system` calls.

It also needs a 256 colors terminal like `iTerm`.

## TODO

* Parse command line options
* Study mode
* Enable working with o without voice
* A mode for hearing or reading a color and having to pick one from the list
